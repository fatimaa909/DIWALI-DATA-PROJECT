# DIWALI-DATA-PROJECT
In this project, we'll explore the Diwali Sales dataset. The dataset contains various customers who have purchased different products, their age, gender, marital status, and occupation. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover hidden trends, outliers, correlations, and other important aspects of the data.
